## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I needed to go back to basics since I had to take a break from coding for a couple of weeks. Through this project I did a recap on CSS properties, learned something new about `background-blend-mode` and finally got the momentum to insert webkit vendor flags. 

### Useful resources

- [Exploring Blend Modes in CSS](https://alligator.io/css/exploring-blend-modes/) - This helped me read more about blend modes. I chose the overlay, by taking the accent colour and transforming it to HEX from HSLA. 
- [Autoprefixer CSS online](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - This was my first time using vendor prefixes. I want to hear feedback from the community.
